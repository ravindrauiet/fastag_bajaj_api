# FasTag Registration Tracking System - Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

I've implemented a comprehensive tracking system for the FasTag registration process that:

1. **Tracks the User Context**: Records the user's Firebase Auth UID and display name when they are logged in and submitting any registration form.

2. **Captures Registration Stages**: Tracks each stage of the FasTag registration process:
   - ValidateCustomerScreen -> ValidateOtpScreen -> DocumentUploadScreen -> ManualActivationScreen -> FasTagRegistrationScreen

3. **Stores Data in Firebase**: Creates separate collections in Firebase for the registration process:
   - `fastagRegistrations`: Main collection for complete registration records
   - `registrationStages`: Collection for individual stage completions (useful for analytics)

4. **Preserves Existing Functionality**: All existing code and form submission logic remains untouched.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Created:

1. **FasTagTracker.js**: The core tracking utility that handles all Firebase interactions.

2. **FasTagRegistrationHelper.js**: Helper functions to make tracking easier in each screen.

3. **fastagRegistrationsApi.js**: API functions to retrieve and query registration data.

### Modified Files:

I've enhanced these existing files by adding our tracking system:

1. **FormLogger.js**: Added integration with FasTag tracking.

2. **FormTracker.js**: Added support for tracking FasTag registration stages.

3. **firestore.rules**: Updated security rules to protect the new collections.

### Integration In Each Screen:

I've added FasTag tracking to each screen of the registration flow:

1. **ValidateCustomerScreen.jsx**: Tracks initial customer validation.

2. **ValidateOtpScreen.jsx**: Tracks OTP verification.

3. **DocumentUploadScreen.jsx**: Tracks document upload process.

4. **ManualActivationScreen.jsx**: Tracks manual activation details.

5. **FasTagRegistrationScreen.jsx**: Tracks the final registration step.

## How It Works

The tracking system:

1. Creates a registration record when the user starts the process
2. Updates the record at each stage of the registration
3. Records timestamps, form data, and user information
4. Tracks success/failure at each stage
5. Maintains a complete history of the registration process

All this is implemented without modifying any existing functionality - only adding the new tracking layer on top.

## Usage

The tracking is automatic and requires no changes to how users interact with the app. For admin/reporting purposes, you can query the tracking data using the functions in `fastagRegistrationsApi.js`.
